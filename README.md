1. SHOOTING
A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die. List the possible
reasons for the man not dying.

An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume that the
alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a clear step-by-step
instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as you can. (Example: Hold the toothpaste with
your left hand; turn the cap anti-clockwise)
